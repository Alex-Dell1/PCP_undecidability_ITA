# Undecidability of PCP (Italian)
These are the slides I prepared for a master's degree lecture for a course in Logics for Applications. As of right now I can only offer an Italian version.

Feel free to use them, edit them (if you can figure my .tex file out) or, if you wish, work on an English translation yourself.
